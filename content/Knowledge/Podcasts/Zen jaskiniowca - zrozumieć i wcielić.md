title: Zen jaskiniowca - zrozumieć i wcielić
---

Rafał ([[Personal development/Resources/Zen Jaskiniowca/_index]]) is such a great person that he even records audio versions of his articles. I personally listen to them in order to consolidate my knowledge and his noteworthy anecdotes, which he often adds. Sometimes he also invites very interesting people to talk in a slightly looser way, but still very substantive.
