## Why do I learn Italian?
One day, I listened to a [cool Italian song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOv7jMLlhYo) and decided that I would like to understand it, and literally this is how I started learning. Of course, I know that there are such things as translators, but I chose not to use them and set myself a quite demanding challenge. 

## Study plan
It's pretty simple, learn using [Busuu](https://www.busuu.com) 30min each day, in the free time repeat vocabulary, create own sentences. 
I recommend everyone to buy premium plan if you value your [[Productivity/Time]].
