**Evolve or die!**

What really interested me were the "x" day challenges (e.g. 90 days of [[Personal development/Habits/Cold showers]]). From my point of view this methodology is very powerful for following reasons:
1. It teaches [[Personal development/Psychology/Discipline]]
2. A fixed number of days motivates you not to give up, especially at the beginning (you play a kind of [[Core/Concepts/Life as a game|Game]] in which each day is another point)
3. It can quickly diagnose the state of our addiction to something (if you think that you aren't addicted to something, try not to use it for completely for a while, e.g. try 30 days of [[Personal development/Psychology/Social media]] detox, I promise you will see the results immediately)
