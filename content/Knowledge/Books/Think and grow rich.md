My notes, quotes and [[Personal development/Concepts/_index]]

### Desire
> [!success] The starting point of all achievement is desire
>
> Keep this constantly in mind.

### Faith
> [!tldr] What is faith?
>
> Faith is the “eternal elixir” which gives life, power, and action to the impulse of thought!

> [!bug] About creating delusions 
>
> If a man repeats a lie over and over, he will eventually accept the lie as truth. Moreover, he will believe it to be the truth.

> [!Quote] You are not doomed
>
> There are millions of people who **believe themselves “doomed”** to poverty and failure, because of some strange force over which they believe they have no control. **They are** the **creators** of their own **"misfortunes"**, because of this negative belief, which is picked up by the subconscious mind, and translated into its physical equivalent.

### Definitive plans
> [!info] Your achievement can be no greater than your plans are sound
>
> That may seem to be an axiomatic statement, but it is true.

### Subconscious mind 

> [!tldr] The best advice, how to communicate effectively with your subconscious mind
> 
> You are preparing yourself to influence and control the “inner audience” of your subconscious mind, in order to hand over to it the desire for money, which you wish transmuted into its monetary equivalent. It is essential, therefore, that you understand the method of approach to this “inner audience.” You must speak its language, or it will not heed your call. It understands best the language of emotion or feeling.

> [!Hint] You will acquire the ability to reach, and to influence your subconscious mind. 
> 
> Do not become **discouraged**, if you cannot do this upon the **first attempt**. Remember that the subconscious mind may be voluntarily directed **only through habit**, under the directions given in the chapter on faith. You have not yet had time to master faith. **Be patient. Be persistent**

> [!success] Here is a most significant fact
>
> The subconscious mind takes any orders given it in a spirit of absolute faith, and acts upon those orders, although the orders often have to be presented over and over again, through repetition, before they are interpreted by the subconscious mind.

> [!Bug] The subconscious mind will not remain idle! 
> 
> If you fail to plant desires in your subconscious mind, it will feed upon the thoughts which reach it as the result of your neglect. We have already explained that thought impulses, both negative and positive are reaching the subconscious mind continuously.

### Auto suggestion
> [!Quote] Think positive, it really works
> 
> Through the dominating thoughts which one permits to remain in the **conscious** mind, (whether these thoughts be **negative or positive**, is immaterial), the principle of auto-suggestion voluntarily reaches the subconscious mind and influences it with these thoughts.

> [!success] Unfortunately, there is no legal protection against those who, either by design or ignorance, poison the minds of others by negative suggestion.
> 
> This form of destruction should be punishable by heavy legal penalties, because it may and often does destroy one’s chances of acquiring material things which are protected by law

### Knowledge
> [!Hint] Knowledge will not attract money
> 
> **UNLESS** it is organized, and intelligently directed, through practical plans of action, to the definite end of accumulation of money. Lack of understanding of this fact has been the source of confusion to millions of people who falsely believe that “knowledge is power.” **It is nothing of the sort!** Knowledge is only potential power. It becomes power only when, and if, it is organized into definite plans of action, and directed to a definite end.

### [[Personal development/Habits/_index]]
> [!bug] Invisible harmful habit
>
> Every intelligent person knows that stimulation in excess, through alcoholic drink and narcotics, is a form of intemperance which destroys the vital organs of the body, including the brain. Not every person knows, however, that over indulgence in sex expression may become a habit as destructive and as detrimental to creative effort as narcotics or liquor.

>[!hint] Form the habit of applying and using the positive emotions
>
> Eventually, they will **dominate your mind** so completely, that the negatives cannot enter it.

### Brain / Mind
>[!tldr] The Brain is Broadcasting and Receiving Station for Thought
>
> The **subconscious mind** is the “sending station” of the brain, through which vibrations of thought are broadcast. The **Creative Imagination** is the “receiving set,” through which the vibrations of thought are picked up from the ether.

>[!hint] The Greatest Forces Are “Intangible”
>
>The depression brought the world to the very border-line of understanding of the forces which are intangible and unseen. Through the ages which have passed, man has depended too much upon his physical senses, and has limited his knowledge to physical things, which he could see, touch, weigh, and measure.

> [!info] Mind control is the result of self-discipline and habit. 
> 
> You either control your mind or it controls you. There is no hall-way compromise. The most practical of all methods for controlling the mind is the habit of keeping

### Fear
>[!danger] Decisions is the seedling of fear! Remember this, as you read.
>
> Indecision crystalizes into doubt, the two blend and become fear! The “blending” process often is slow. This is one reason why these three enemies are so dangerous. They germinate and grow without their presence being observed.**

>[!success] Symptoms of the Fear of Poverty
>
> - indifference - commonly express through lack of ambition; willingness to tolerate poverty
> - indecision - the habit of permitting others to do one's thinking
> - doubt -  generally expressed through alibis and excuses designed to cover up, explain away, or apologise for one’s failures, sometimes expressed in the form of envy of those who are successful, or by criticising them.
> - worry -  usually expressed by finding fault with others, a tendency to spend beyond one’s income, neglect of personal appearance
> - over-caution -  the habit of looking for the negative side of every circumstance, thinking and talking of possible failure instead of concentrating upon the means of succeeding. Knowing all the roads to disaster, but never searching for the plans to avoid failure.
> - [[Personal development/Brain/Procrastination]]-  the habit of putting off until tomorrow that which should have been done last year

>[!tldr] A reputable physician estimated that 75% of all people who visit physicians for professional service are suffering with hypochondria.
>
>It has been shown most convincingly that the fear of disease, even where there is not the slightest cause for fear, often produces the physical symptoms of the disease feared.
