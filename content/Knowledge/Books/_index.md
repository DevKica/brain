Some tips for reading books:
- Don't hesitate to read something several times -  it's not about how many books you can read, it's about how many you can learn from them. Of course, this does not apply to all books, but I read books mainly to learn from them, not just to read

List of books worth reading:
- [[Knowledge/Books/Think and Grow Rich]]
