## Never stop learning:

### Books

Don't hesitate to read something several times -  it's not about how many books you can read, it's about how many you can learn from them. Of course, this does not apply to all books, but I read books mainly to learn from them, not just to read - also takes notes and implement new knowledge.

List of books worth reading:
- [[Knowledge/Do the work]]
- [[Knowledge/Think and Grow Rich]]
- [[Knowledge/Power of your subconscious mind]]

### Podcasts

Top Tier Tip - If you have the choice whether to listen or read something, choose reading! - trust me, it will benefit you! 
Also the same tip as when reading **books** - don't hesitate to listen to something several times
