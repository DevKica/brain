Very solid resource of knowledge on how to start a journey to understand your brain and regain control of your life. What really interested me was his "x" day challenges (e.g. 90 days of cold showers). I really like this methodology for following reasons:
1. It teaches [[Productivity/Discipline]]
2. A fixed number of days motivates you not to give up, especially at the beginning (you play a kind of [[Productivity/Game]] in which each day is another point)
3. Can quickly diagnose the state of our addiction to something (if you think that you aren't addicted to something, try not to use it for completely for a while, e.g. try 30 days of [[Productivity/Social media]] detox, I promise you will see the results immediately)
