This youtube channel is a very solid resource to understand how your [[Personal development/Brain/_index]] works and begin the first steps in regaining control of your life. What really interested me was the "x" day challenges (e.g. 90 days of [[Personal development/Habits/Cold showers]]). From my point of view this methodology is very powerful for following reasons:
1. It teaches [[Productivity/Discipline]]
2. A fixed number of days motivates you not to give up, especially at the beginning (you play a kind of [[Personal development/Concepts/Life as a game|Game]] in which each day is another point)
3. It can quickly diagnose the state of our addiction to something (if you think that you aren't addicted to something, try not to use it for completely for a while, e.g. try 30 days of [[Productivity/Social media]] detox, I promise you will see the results immediately)
