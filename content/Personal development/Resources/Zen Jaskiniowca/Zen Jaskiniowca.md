About **Zen Jaskiniowca (Rafał Mazur)** - I have always been skeptical about the broadly understood personal development industry, but Rafał has a very unconventional and interesting approach to various topics related to it. He is a wonderful person whose articles can change everyone's life. I sincerely encourage everyone to read and implement the methods described in them. Of course, you will not be able to combine them all, but just choose the most optimal one that will help you achieve your goals.

Unfortunately, I didn't find any translations of his articles, I planned to translate them while reading, but I felt that's not the best way to spend my time in my current situation, maybe I will come back to this someday, although I managed to translate two of them which are very worth reading.
