### About the harmfulness of compassion and pity

When I say aloud, that one of the most important characteristic for everyone who wants to achieve anything is ruthlessness, people see me like as a psychopath and Adolf Hitler of coaching. When I say about that compassion and pity are harmful emotional states - the same people are sure that I will reopen concentration camps. Let me, therefore, profane in joy this Judeo-Christian myth of the usefulness of mercy through pity and compassion. 

When we talk about compassion, this word means that you feel (or rather you think you feel if we want to be more accurate) something that someone is feeling. In other words, you are uniting in despair, for example. Because you feel exactly the same (as you think you feel) one of you actually becomes redundant. Emotionally nods. It's like the thoughtless saying that a successful relationship is two halves - implying that one is a bum and the other is a bum. A successful relationship does not consist of two halves, but two unities. I am not any half! Neither is she any half! And thanks to this, we can create a successful larger whole. Okay, because I got distracted.

So we already know that compassion means that you become a pin - you join the choir and sign like him. There is also pity. Lean over someone in pity. Exactly - for me, pity means a sense of superiority. Recognition of the other person(s) as victim incapable of acting independently and fighting against or for something. There is some form of sadistic power and exaltation in pity. For me, at least. So let's take a look at what the alternative is. 

The only correct alternative is empathy.

What is a difference between an empathy and compassion? Such that empathy means understanding, not emotionally nodding. It does NOT mean that you are emotionally in solidarity. You understand what this someone is going through, perhaps because you were "there", maybe you got out of similar or bigger shit and you know that you can be helpful. Not by being a worthless jelly from the helping point of view, but by motivating and inspiring someone to a positive action. Before I explain this further, two important points. The first is what you pay attention to. Basically, everyone has heard it up to puke - what you pay attention to grows.

> Whatever the theorist comes up with, the practitioner will prove it

Are you looking for conspiracies, layouts, strings and hands that pull on them - you will find. You will find it for sure. Are you concentrating on why you can't? This you will find out - abundantly - why it is not possible. You focus on what you can do - you will find solutions or at least try. I don't want to hit a bit unimaginable things, but there is actually something magical in life - because your mind generates it to some extent.

So we have a matter of what you should pay attention to. To something that might give a positive result (a solution or something creative) or you get distracted by everything else.

Second element, a matter of duty. In other words - a sense of mission, a task. What for some is an option, a choice, loose obligation or even a nightmare for others (a few) is duty. Let's take my beloved topic - diets. 95% of the people will not reach their goal or keep weight. Why?

Because they don't take it as their fucking duty! For them is is whim, a matter of "
free will" and all that metaphysical shit. Why did I lose weight and why do I keep reducing my body fat at the same time increasing the amount of muscle mass? Because it's my duty.

It is my moral duty to reach my full potential - also in this part of my life. My mission, my task.

Empathy means that I understand what you are going through, so I can help you. I can because I understand. Emotions are overrated. Crying together will not handle the problem. Laughing together also not. Problem is solved by effective action. Therefore, I have NO compassion and pity for fat people. Because I know it's their fault (yes yes I know, you are in a small group of genetically or endocrinologically burdened, I know, eat something to calm down). I have no compassion and pity, because I was there and I know that it can be changed. Only the complaining, snotty fat man is worse than the fat man. (I mark the words - **you can change** - as opposed to, for example, some forms of disability).

I've always liked the sheep herd and shepherd dog metaphor. The Sheepdog is sharp and dry in relation to sheep, he pushes them on, treats them not very subtly. But it is he who protects them from the highest evil - the wolves. Shepherd (for a moment we will treat a shepherd dog as a human) doesn't give a shit what sheep think of him, not because of the fact that he is blase or he doesn't care. It is just secondary, because he is the LOYAL task to be done. He has its responsibilities. He is supposed to protect - not be liked. He is supposed to help - not be accepted. This is his mission. He is focused on it in one point.

This is why empathy is good and compassion and pity are harmful. They are like a small cell cancer - you cannot see it in the pictures and when it becomes visible it is usually too late.

The worst, absolutely worst, kind of pity is self-pity. Am I saying that you are to hurt yourself and hate yourself? Absolutely not - quite the opposite. You should feel ruthless love to yourself. Ruthless love - to explain - is not that you love yourself ruthless. I don't believe in ruthless love (maybe a mother to a child, I don't know, I probably won't experience being a mother, so I have no idea).  I talk about rough self-love. Demanding. 

Demanding what? Demanding from yourself ACHIEVING YOUR FULL POTENTIAL. And for that you usually need someone who knows what he is doing and who is ruthless (see "Whiplash"). In one of the best scenes, the nice looking gentleman in the photo says there are no two more harmful words than "good job". Why? Because they condemn you to be good, to be complacent, to be average - to fat in satisfaction.

Ralph Waldo Emerson once said that:

>Our greatest wish in life is to meet someone who will force us to do what we can.

Who will force us to reach our full potential, to be the best version of ourselves. May it be someone ruthless.

You already know why compassion and pity are the greatest enemies of people who want something other than mediocrity.
