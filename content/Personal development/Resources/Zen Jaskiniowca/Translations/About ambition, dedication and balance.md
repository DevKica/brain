### About ambition, dedication and balance

You may or may not like Ayn Rand, but the success that she has achieved is astronomical. It reminds me a bit of the Arnold story. She leaves post-revolutionary Russia in order to live in USA - without any language skills, without any acquaintances. A complete different country and culture. She doesn't know English - so she decides to become a writer (quite logical, isn't it?). First scripts, then novels. In the end - she is a famous author, and the creator of their own philosophical trend ([objectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism)).

Now let's see what she had been saying to herself to get where she eventually got (??).


> **Concentration!!!**
Learn to appreciate actions and effort. Understand that this type of work is specific and  requires specific state of mind, other than doing nothing. You can't write while doing something else.
**After all, are you living for action or for rest? Stop admiring yourself like that - you're still nobody.** You have to know how to control you moods and mind. To be the master of yourself and your mind. How do you want to lead others if you don't lead your mind?      
**The secret of live: you have to be a pure willpower.** You have to know what you want, and do it. Be aware, minute by minute, what you're doing and why. Absolute willpower, absolute control. Send everything else to hell. Be a tyrant - no compromises with yourself. Do everything totally (with yourself). 
(...) From now on - no thought of yourself, think only about work. You're just a typewriter. And don't stop until you genuinely and sincerely know, that you can't go on anymore.
**Aye Rand** - The Journals of Ayn Rand

This is a record of her internal dialogue - put on paper ("A note to myself").

Now tell me - does she sound like someone looking for equilibrium in life? Who is looking for balance - whatever that means? Who decides to wait for motivation to appear or listen to [Tony Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robbins)? Who, as befits an artist, "comes into closer contact with his emotional side of existence"? Like someone who follows a [4-hour working week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_4-Hour_Workweek)? 

Because to me it sounds like someone going to war, someone who doesn't take any hostages, someone who burns bridges and any way back. 

I don't know anyone, either personally or from books, who excelled above the average, looking for balance and peace. I do not know and never will, because it is impossible.

"Life is to enjoy every moment", "don't work so hard because you will burnout", "you act like you're obsessed, it isn't normal". It's obvious it isn't. Because only a few is outstanding. Because only a few are outstanding, so how can you measure them with mediocrity? If the people around you, don't say there is something wrong with you, you're acting abnormally, that you have an obsession - this means that your thinking and actions are average. If they praise you - you can be sure that, you're equal to them. If they understand you - you're wasting your potential. 

Read Rand's words again. Do you see self-pity here? Do you see seeking relaxation?
