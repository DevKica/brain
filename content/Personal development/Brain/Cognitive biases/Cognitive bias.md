> [!tldr] Definition
>
> A **cognitive bias** is a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. Individuals create their own **subjective reality** from their perception of the input. An individual's construction of reality, not the objective input, may dictate their behavior in the world. Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality.
