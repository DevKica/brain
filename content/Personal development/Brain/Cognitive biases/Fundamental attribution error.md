### Definition
>In social psychology, **fundamental attribution error**, also known as **correspondence bias** or **attribution effect**, is the tendency for people to under-emphasize situational and environmental explanations for an individual's observed behavior while overemphasizing dispositional and personality-based explanations. This effect has been described as **"the tendency to believe that what people do reflects who they are"**, that is, to overattribute their behaviors (what they do or say) to their personality and underattribute them to the situation or context.

>[!Hint] It involves a type of circular reasoning 
>
>The answer to the question **"why would they do that"** is only **"because they would do that"**.


>The mere observation of another person's behavior results in the automatic ascribing of a trait consistent with his behavior. On the other hand, taking into account situational factors is a controlled process and requires attention.

### Example
> Consider the situation where Alice, a driver, is **cut off in traffic** by Bob. Alice attributes Bob's behavior to his **fundamental personality**, e.g., he thinks only of himself, he is selfish, he is a jerk, he is an unskilled driver; **she does not think it is situational**, e.g., he is going to miss his flight, his wife is giving birth at the hospital, his daughter is convulsing at school. Alice might well make the opposite mistake and **excuse herself** by saying she was influenced by situational causes, e.g., I am late for my job interview, I must pick up my son for his dental appointment, rather than thinking **she has a character flaw**, e.g., I am such a jerk, I treat others with contempt, I am bad at driving.
