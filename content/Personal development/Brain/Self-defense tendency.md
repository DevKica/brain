title: Self-defense tendency
---

### Definition
>The phenomenon of assigning **oneself** (on the basis of [[Personal development/Brain/Dispositional attribution]]) responsibility for successes, and responsibility for one's failures (through [[Personal development/Brain/Situational attribution]]) to external factors. It serves to protect your self-esteem. 

### Example 
From police records describing the statement of the driver who caused the accident: "The telephone pole was approaching fast, I was trying to get out of the way when it hit the front of my car." 

>[!Hint] The self-defense tendency is considered a healthy phenomenon
>
> It appears in the majority of mentally healthy people. However, in order to make decisions more **conscious**, it's worth being aware of it
