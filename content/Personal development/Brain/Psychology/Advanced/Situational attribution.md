title: Situational attribution
---

### Definition

> Situational attribution assumes that someone's behavior is caused by situational or external factors (e.g. coincidence, difficulty of a task, misfortune, weather, etc.) as opposed to one's own characteristics and choices (skills or lack thereof, intelligence, effort, etc.)

>[!Hint] People generally tend to use internal rather than external attribution too often
>
> This effect is called the [[Personal development/Brain/Psychology/Advanced/Fundamental attribution error]].
