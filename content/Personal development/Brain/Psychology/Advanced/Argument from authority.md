title: Argument from authority
---

### Definition
>An **argument from authority**, also called an **appeal to authority** is a form of argument in which the opinion of an authority on a topic is used as evidence to support an argument. When a person invoked as an authority on the subject is actually wrong, a [[Personal development/Brain/Psychology/Advanced/Cognitive bias]] occurs.

### Example
> Person or persons A claim that X is true.  
> Person or persons A are experts in the field concerning X.  
> Therefore, X should be believed.

### Use in science
>Scientific knowledge is best established by evidence and experiment rather than argued through authority as authority has **no place in science**. 

> [!Quote] **Carl Sagan** wrote of arguments from authority
> 
> One of the great commandments of science is, "Mistrust arguments from authority." ... Too many such arguments have proved too painfully wrong. Authorities must prove their contentions like everybody else

>One example of the use of the appeal to authority in science dates to 1923, when leading American zoologist Theophilus Painter declared, based on poor data and conflicting observations he had made, that humans had 24 pairs of chromosomes. From the 1920s until 1956, scientists propagated this "fact" based on Painter's authority, despite subsequent counts totaling the correct number of 23. Even textbooks with photos showing 23 pairs incorrectly declared the number to be 24 based on the authority of the then-consensus of 24 pairs.
