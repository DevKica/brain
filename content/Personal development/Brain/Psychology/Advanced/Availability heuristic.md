title: Availability heuristic

### Definition
>The **availability heuristic**, also known as **availability bias**, is a **mental shortcut** that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. The availability heuristic operates on the notion that **if something can be recalled, it must be important**, or at least more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled. Subsequently, under the availability heuristic, **people tend to weigh their judgments** heavily toward more recent information, making new opinions biased toward that latest news.

>[!Hint] In other words
>
>The easier it is to recall the consequences of something, the greater those consequences are often perceived to be.

### Example
>After seeing news stories about child abductions, people **may judge that the likelihood** of this event is greater. **Media coverage can help fuel a person's example bias** with widespread and extensive coverage of **unusual events**, such as homicide or airline accidents, and less coverage of **more routine, less sensational events**, such as common diseases or car accidents. **For example**, when asked to rate the probability of a variety of causes of death, people tend to rate "newsworthy" events as more likely, because they can more **readily recall an example** from memory. Moreover, **unusual** and vivid events like homicides, shark attacks, or lightning are more often reported in mass media than common and **un-sensational** causes of death like common diseases.
