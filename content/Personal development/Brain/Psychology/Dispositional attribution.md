### Definition

> Dispositional attribution (or internal attribution) is a phrase in personality psychology that refers to the **tendency to assign responsibility** for others' behaviors due to their **inherent characteristics**, such as their motives, beliefs or personality, rather than the **external (situational)** influences, such as the individual's environment or culture.

> When making an **internal attribution**, people attempt to explain the cause of a situation or event to personal factors, often in a **generalized** sense.
