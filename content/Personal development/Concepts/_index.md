What are the ***Concepts*** for me? 

Maybe we'll start by asking what I was looking for in my life?

todo
// freedom
// some sort of patters
// knowledge
// a lot of options
// answer to everything
// bind it to subconscious
// a lot of knowledge :D
// handle contradictions
// do not think 0/1
// think! don't be carried by emotions
