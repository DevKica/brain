 > [!hint]  Two Day Rule is all about not taking more than one day off from a good [[Personal development/Habits/_index|habit]] or productive routine.
 > 
 > The main idea is to build consistency, and avoid falling into long periods when we do not stick to habits. It's about forming habit to sticking to habits.
