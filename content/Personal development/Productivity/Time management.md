### To-do list - because our brains are terrible at remembering
- I've used many to-do list apps, and in my opinion the best one is [[Tools/Todoist]]

### Pomodoro technique - divide and conquer
-  I recommend to start with 25 minutes of focus, then increase to a maximum of 45-50 minutes
- Don't neglect breaks - it'll often happen that time is up and you're in the middle of a task, but just stop, take a break and come back to it with a fresh mindset
- What to do during breaks? Literally nothing, lie on the bed and give your mind a rest. Try not to go on social media during every break (e.g. set a rule that only one out of every four breaks you can spend on social media)
