### To-do list 
-  Why? Because our brains are terrible at remembering
- I've used many to-do list apps, and in my opinion the best one is [[Tools/Todoist]]


### Deep work
- Long focus sessions lasting from 60 to 90 minutes
- Clearly define your goals and tasks before starting session
- Disable all notifications, create a distraction-free environment conducive to deep focus
- Don't neglect breaks - it'll often happen that time is up and you're in the middle of a task, but just stop, take a break and come back to it with a fresh mindset. Also after 90 minutes you aren't able to focus well.
