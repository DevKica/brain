 # Useful habits
 
### Cold Showers
Just try to start with 1 minute and then slowly work your way up to 3 minutes. Cold showers will help you boost your immune system, improve the quality of your skin and most importantly, overcome the [[Personal development/Brain/Resistance]] to doing uncomfortable things on a daily basis.

### Meditation
I'm trying to meditate every day (from 3 to 10 minutes) using [[Tools/Medito]]. It helps me to be more aware of my thoughts.

### Drinking water (a lot of)
A simple, very healthy habit, I drink an average of 3 liters of water a day.

### No sweet drinks
Drink water instead.  Most sweet drinks are just liquid sugar which isn't very healthy. Of course, remember that I'm talking about a **habit**, no one forbids you to drink a glass of juice **once a week.**

### Limiting music listening
Nowadays, everyone listens to music ALL the time. While studying, exercising, taking a short walk, driving a car. We don't let our mind rest, we don't want to be left with only our own thoughts.  
And I think it's a huge mistake, because even if, for example, driving a car without music is boring, most often in such moments (of boredom) valuable ideas and reflections came to my mind. 
Currently, I've been driving without music in the car for over a year, and I recommend everyone to try it, at least for a month.
