### Definition

> Attribution is a term used in psychology which deals with how **individuals** perceive the causes of everyday experience, as being either external or internal.  Models to explain this process are called **attribution theory**.

We distinguish between two types of attribution:
- [[Personal development/Psychology/Dispositional attribution]]
- [[Personal development/Psychology/Situational attribution]]

### Example
> John failed his psychology exam.
>
> An example of [[Personal development/Psychology/Dispositional attribution]]: John is stupid.
> 
> Example of [[Personal development/Psychology/Situational attribution]]: There were difficult questions.
