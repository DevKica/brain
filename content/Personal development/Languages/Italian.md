## Why do I learn Italian?
One day, I listened to a [cool Italian song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOv7jMLlhYo) and decided that I would like to understand it, and literally this is how I started learning. Of course, I know that there are such things as translators, but I chose not to use them and set myself a quite demanding challenge. 

## Study plan
I learn using [[Tools/Bussu]], recommend everyone to buy premium plan if you value your [[Personal development/Concepts/Time]].
