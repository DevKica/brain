 # Useful habits
 
### Cold Showers
Just try to start with 1 minute, it'll help you in overcoming [[Personal development/Brain/Resistance]]

### No sweet drinks
Drink water instead.  Most sweet drinks are just liquid sugar which isn't very healthy. Of course, remember that I'm talking about a **habit**, no one forbids you to drink a glass of juice **once a week.**

### Drinking water (a lot of)
A simple, very healthy habit, I drink an average of 3 liters of water a day.

### Meditation
I'm trying to meditate every day (from 3 to 10 minutes) using [[Tools/Medito]].
