It is essential, therefore, that you understand the method of approach to this ‚Äúinner audience.‚Äù You must speak its language, or it will not heed your call.

Remember that the subconscious mind may be voluntarily directed **only through habit**, under the directions given in the chapter on faith. You have not yet had time to master faith. **Be patient. Be persistent**\n\n\u003e [!success] Here is a most significant fact\n\u003e\n\u003e The subconscious mind takes any orders given it in a spirit of absolute faith, and acts upon those orders, although the orders often have to be presented over and over again, through repetition, before they are interpreted by the subconscious mind.\n\n\u003e [!Bug] The subconscious mind will not remain idle! \n\u003e \n\u003e If you fail to plant desires in your subconscious mind, it will feed upon the thoughts which reach it as the result of your neglect.
