Too many such arguments have proved too painfully wrong.

From the 1920s until 1956, scientists propagated this \"fact\" based on Painter's authority, despite subsequent counts totaling the correct number of 23. Even textbooks with photos showing 23 pairs incorrectly declared the number to be 24 based on the authority of the then-consensus of 24 pairs.\n\nReferences: [Argument from authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority)","lastmodified":"2022-12-03T16:56:22.954223921Z","tags":null},"/Personal-development/Brain/Attribution":{"title":"Attribution","content":"\n### Definition\n\n\u003e Attribution is a term used in psychology which deals with how **individuals** perceive the causes of everyday experience, as being either external or internal. ¬†Models to explain this process are called¬†**attribution theory**.\n\nWe distinguish between two types of attribution:\n- [[Personal development/Brain/Dispositional attribution]]\n- [[Personal development/Brain/Situational attribution]]\n\n### Example\n\u003e John failed his psychology exam.\n\u003e\n\u003e An example of [[Personal development/Brain/Dispositional attribution]]: John is stupid.\n\u003e \n\u003e Example of [[Personal development/Brain/Situational attribution]]: There were difficult questions.\n\nRelated notes: [[Personal development/Brain/Fundamental attribution error]]\n\nReferences: [Attribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_(psychology))","lastmodified":"2022-12-03T16:56:22.954223921Z","tags":null},"/Personal-development/Brain/Availability-heuristic":{"title":"Availability heuristic","content":"\n### Definition\n\u003eThe **availability heuristic**, also known as **availability bias**, is a **mental shortcut** that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision.

Moreover, **unusual** and vivid events like homicides, shark attacks, or lightning are more often reported in mass media than common and **un-sensational** causes of death like common diseases.\n\nReferences: [Availability heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic)","lastmodified":"2022-12-03T16:56:22.954223921Z","tags":null},"/Personal-development/Brain/Cognitive-bias":{"title":"Cognitive bias","content":"\n\u003e [!tldr] Definition\n\u003e\n\u003e A¬†**cognitive bias**¬†is a systematic pattern of deviation from¬†norm¬†or rationality in judgment.¬†Individuals create their own **subjective reality** from their perception of the input.

On the other hand, taking into account situational factors is a controlled process and requires attention.\n\n### Example\n\u003e Consider the situation where Alice, a driver, is **cut off in traffic** by Bob. Alice attributes Bob's behavior to his **fundamental personality**, e.g., he thinks only of himself, he is selfish, he is a jerk, he is an unskilled driver; **she does not think it is situational**, e.g., he is going to miss his flight, his wife is giving birth at the hospital, his daughter is convulsing at school. Alice might well make the opposite mistake and **excuse herself** by saying she was influenced by situational causes, e.g., I am late for my job interview, I must pick up my son for his dental appointment, rather than thinking **she has a character flaw**, e.g., I am such a jerk, I treat others with contempt, I am bad at driving.\n\n\u003e [!Hint] Be aware of how your mind works\n\u003e\n\u003e People have tendency to justify **THEIR** behavior through **SITUATIONAL** factors, but the behavior of **OTHERS** through personal factors.
