Moreover, he will believe it to be the truth.\n\n\u003e [!Quote] You are not doomed\n\u003e\n\u003e There are millions of people who **believe themselves “doomed”** to poverty and failure, because of some strange force over which they believe they have no control. **They are** the **creators** of their own **\"misfortunes\"**, because of this negative belief, which is picked up by the subconscious mind, and translated into its physical equivalent.\n\n### Definitive plans\n\u003e [!info] Your achievement can be no greater than your plans are sound\n\u003e\n\u003e That may seem to be an axiomatic statement, but it is true.\n\n### Subconscious mind \n\n\u003e [!tldr] The best advice, how to communicate effectively with your subconscious mind\n\u003e \n\u003e You are preparing yourself to influence and control the “inner audience” of your subconscious mind, in order to hand over to it the desire for money, which you wish transmuted into its monetary equivalent. It is essential, therefore, that you understand the method of approach to this “inner audience.” You must speak its language, or it will not heed your call. It understands best the language of emotion or feeling.\n\n\u003e [!Hint] You will acquire the ability to reach, and to influence your subconscious mind. \n\u003e \n\u003e Do not become **discouraged**, if you cannot do this upon the **first attempt**.

When a person invoked as an authority on the subject is actually wrong, a [[Personal development/Brain/Psychology/Cognitive bias]] occurs.\n\n### Example\n\u003e Person or persons A claim that X is true.  \n\u003e Person or persons A are experts in the field concerning X.  \n\u003e Therefore, X should be believed.\n\n### Use in science\n\u003eScientific knowledge is best established by evidence and experiment rather than argued through authority as authority has **no place in science**. \n\n\u003e [!Quote] **Carl Sagan** wrote of arguments from authority\n\u003e \n\u003e One of the great commandments of science is, \"Mistrust arguments from authority.\" ... Too many such arguments have proved too painfully wrong. Authorities must prove their contentions like everybody else\n\n\u003eOne example of the use of the appeal to authority in science dates to 1923, when leading American zoologist Theophilus Painter declared, based on poor data and conflicting observations he had made, that humans had 24 pairs of chromosomes. From the 1920s until 1956, scientists propagated this \"fact\" based on Painter's authority, despite subsequent counts totaling the correct number of 23. Even textbooks with photos showing 23 pairs incorrectly declared the number to be 24 based on the authority of the then-consensus of 24 pairs.\n\nReferences: [Argument from authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority)","lastmodified":"2022-10-11T21:42:28.174954327Z","tags":null},"/Personal-development/Brain/Psychology/Attribution":{"title":"Attribution","content":"\n### Definition\n\n\u003e Attribution is a term used in psychology which deals with how **individuals** perceive the causes of everyday experience, as being either external or internal.  Models to explain this process are called **attribution theory**.\n\nWe distinguish between two types of attribution:\n- [[Personal development/Brain/Psychology/Dispositional attribution]]\n- [[Personal development/Brain/Psychology/Situational attribution]]\n\n### Example\n\u003e John failed his psychology exam.\n\u003e\n\u003e An example of [[Personal development/Brain/Psychology/Dispositional attribution]]: John is stupid.\n\u003e \n\u003e Example of [[Personal development/Brain/Psychology/Situational attribution]]: There were difficult questions.\n\nRelated notes: [[Personal development/Brain/Psychology/Fundamental attribution error]]\n\nReferences: [Attribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_(psychology))","lastmodified":"2022-10-11T21:42:28.174954327Z","tags":null},"/Personal-development/Brain/Psychology/Availability-heuristic":{"title":"Availability heuristic","content":"\n### Definition\n\u003eThe **availability heuristic**, also known as **availability bias**, is a **mental shortcut** that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision.

On the other hand, taking into account situational factors is a controlled process and requires attention.\n\n### Example\n\u003e Consider the situation where Alice, a driver, is **cut off in traffic** by Bob. Alice attributes Bob's behavior to his **fundamental personality**, e.g., he thinks only of himself, he is selfish, he is a jerk, he is an unskilled driver; **she does not think it is situational**, e.g., he is going to miss his flight, his wife is giving birth at the hospital, his daughter is convulsing at school. Alice might well make the opposite mistake and **excuse herself** by saying she was influenced by situational causes, e.g., I am late for my job interview, I must pick up my son for his dental appointment, rather than thinking **she has a character flaw**, e.g., I am such a jerk, I treat others with contempt, I am bad at driving.\n\n\u003e [!Hint] Be aware of how your mind works\n\u003e\n\u003e People have tendency to justify **THEIR** behavior through **SITUATIONAL** factors, but the behavior of **OTHERS** through personal factors.

It reminds me a bit of the Arnold story. She leaves post-revolutionary Russia in order to live in USA - without any language skills, without any acquaintances. A complete different country and culture. She doesn't know English - so she decides to become a writer (quite logical, isn't it?). First scripts, then novels. In the end - she is a famous author, and the creator of their own philosophical trend ([objectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism)).\n\nNow let's see what she had been saying to herself to get where she eventually got (??).\n\n\n\u003e **Concentration!!!**\nLearn to appreciate actions and effort. Understand that this type of work is specific and  requires specific state of mind, other than doing nothing. You can't write while doing something else.\n**After all, are you living for action or for rest? Stop admiring yourself like that - you're still nobody.** You have to know how to control you moods and mind. To be the master of yourself and your mind. How do you want to lead others if you don't lead your mind?      \n**The secret of live: you have to be a pure willpower.** You have to know what you want, and do it. Be aware, minute by minute, what you're doing and why. Absolute willpower, absolute control. Send everything else to hell. Be a tyrant - no compromises with yourself. Do everything totally (with yourself). \n(...) From now on - no thought of yourself, think only about work. You're just a typewriter. And don't stop until you genuinely and sincerely know, that you can't go on anymore.\n**Aye Rand** - The Journals of Ayn Rand\n\nThis is a record of her internal dialogue - put on paper (\"A note to myself\").\n\nNow tell me - does she sound like someone looking for equilibrium in life? Who is looking for balance - whatever that means? Who decides to wait for motivation to appear or listen to [Tony Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robbins)? Who, as befits an artist, \"comes into closer contact with his emotional side of existence\"? Like someone who follows a [4-hour working week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_4-Hour_Workweek)? \n\nBecause to me it sounds like someone going to war, someone who doesn't take any hostages, someone who burns bridges and any way back. \n\nI don't know anyone, either personally or from books, who excelled above the average, looking for balance and peace. I do not know and never will, because it is impossible.\n\n\"Life is to enjoy every moment\", \"don't work so hard because you will burnout\", \"you act like you're obsessed, it isn't normal\". It's obvious it isn't. Because only a few is outstanding. Because only a few are outstanding, so how can you measure them with mediocrity? If the people around you, don't say there is something wrong with you, you're acting abnormally, that you have an obsession - this means that your thinking and actions are average. If they praise you - you can be sure that, you're equal to them. If they understand you - you're wasting your potential. \n\nRead Rand's words again. Do you see self-pity here? Do you see seeking relaxation?","lastmodified":"2022-10-11T21:42:28.178954372Z","tags":null},"/Personal-development/Resources/Zen-Jaskiniowca/Translated-articles/About-the-harmfulness-of-compassion-and-pity":{"title":"About the harmfulness of compassion and pity","content":"\nTranslation of [Zen Jaskiniowca article](https://zenjaskiniowca.pl/o-szkodliwosci-wspolczucia-i-litosci/)\n\n### About the harmfulness of compassion and pity\n\nWhen I say aloud, that one of the most important characteristic for everyone who wants to achieve anything is ruthlessness, people see me like as a psychopath and Adolf Hitler of coaching. When I say about that compassion and pity are harmful emotional states - the same people are sure that I will reopen concentration camps. Let me, therefore, profane in joy this Judeo-Christian myth of the usefulness of mercy through pity and compassion. \n\nWhen we talk about compassion, this word means that you feel (or rather you think you feel if we want to be more accurate) something that someone is feeling. In other words, you are uniting in despair, for example. Because you feel exactly the same (as you think you feel) one of you actually becomes redundant. Emotionally nods. It's like the thoughtless saying that a successful relationship is two halves - implying that one is a bum and the other is a bum. A successful relationship does not consist of two halves, but two unities. I am not any half! Neither is she any half! And thanks to this, we can create a successful larger whole. Okay, because I got distracted.\n\nSo we already know that compassion means that you become a pin - you join the choir and sign like him. There is also pity. Lean over someone in pity. Exactly - for me, pity means a sense of superiority. Recognition of the other person(s) as victim incapable of acting independently and fighting against or for something. There is some form of sadistic power and exaltation in pity. For me, at least. So let's take a look at what the alternative is. \n\nThe only correct alternative is empathy.\n\nWhat is a difference between an empathy and compassion? Such that empathy means understanding, not emotionally nodding. It does NOT mean that you are emotionally in solidarity. You understand what this someone is going through, perhaps because you were \"there\", maybe you got out of similar or bigger shit and you know that you can be helpful. Not by being a worthless jelly from the helping point of view, but by motivating and inspiring someone to a positive action. Before I explain this further, two important points. The first is what you pay attention to. Basically, everyone has heard it up to puke - what you pay attention to grows.\n\n\u003e Whatever the theorist comes up with, the practitioner will prove it\n\nAre you looking for conspiracies, layouts, strings and hands that pull on them - you will find. You will find it for sure. Are you concentrating on why you can't? This you will find out - abundantly - why it is not possible. You focus on what you can do - you will find solutions or at least try. I don't want to hit a bit unimaginable things, but there is actually something magical in life - because your mind generates it to some extent.\n\nSo we have a matter of what you should pay attention to. To something that might give a positive result (a solution or something creative) or you get distracted by everything else.\n\nSecond element, a matter of duty. In other words - a sense of mission, a task. What for some is an option, a choice, loose obligation or even a nightmare for others (a few) is duty. Let's take my beloved topic - diets. 95% of the people will not reach their goal or keep weight. Why?\n\nBecause they don't take it as their fucking duty! For them is is whim, a matter of \"\nfree will\" and all that metaphysical shit. Why did I lose weight and why do I keep reducing my body fat at the same time increasing the amount of muscle mass? Because it's my duty.\n\nIt is my moral duty to reach my full potential - also in this part of my life. My mission, my task.\n\nEmpathy means that I understand what you are going through, so I can help you. I can because I understand. Emotions are overrated. Crying together will not handle the problem. Laughing together also not. Problem is solved by effective action. Therefore, I have NO compassion and pity for fat people. Because I know it's their fault (yes yes I know, you are in a small group of genetically or endocrinologically burdened, I know, eat something to calm down). I have no compassion and pity, because I was there and I know that it can be changed. Only the complaining, snotty fat man is worse than the fat man. (I mark the words - **you can change** - as opposed to, for example, some forms of disability).\n\nI've always liked the sheep herd and shepherd dog metaphor. The Sheepdog is sharp and dry in relation to sheep, he pushes them on, treats them not very subtly. But it is he who protects them from the highest evil - the wolves. Shepherd (for a moment we will treat a shepherd dog as a human) doesn't give a shit what sheep think of him, not because of the fact that he is blase or he doesn't care. It is just secondary, because he is the LOYAL task to be done. He has its responsibilities. He is supposed to protect - not be liked. He is supposed to help - not be accepted. This is his mission. He is focused on it in one point.\n\nThis is why empathy is good and compassion and pity are harmful. They are like a small cell cancer - you cannot see it in the pictures and when it becomes visible it is usually too late.\n\nThe worst, absolutely worst, kind of pity is self-pity. Am I saying that you are to hurt yourself and hate yourself? Absolutely not - quite the opposite. You should feel ruthless love to yourself. Ruthless love - to explain - is not that you love yourself ruthless. I don't believe in ruthless love (maybe a mother to a child, I don't know, I probably won't experience being a mother, so I have no idea).  I talk about rough self-love. Demanding. \n\nDemanding what? Demanding from yourself ACHIEVING YOUR FULL POTENTIAL. And for that you usually need someone who knows what he is doing and who is ruthless (see \"Whiplash\"). In one of the best scenes, the nice looking gentleman in the photo says there are no two more harmful words than \"good job\". Why? Because they condemn you to be good, to be complacent, to be average - to fat in satisfaction.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson once said that:\n\n\u003eOur greatest wish in life is to meet someone who will force us to do what we can.\n\nWho will force us to reach our full potential, to be the best version of ourselves. May it be someone ruthless.\n\nYou already know why compassion and pity are the greatest enemies of people who want something other than mediocrity.","lastmodified":"2022-10-11T21:42:28.178954372Z","tags":null},"/Personal-development/Sport/":{"title":"Sport","content":"\ndo something bruh","lastmodified":"2022-10-11T21:42:28.178954372Z","tags":null},"/Personal-development/Sport/Tracker":{"title":"Max pushups tracker","content":"\nGoal is pretty simple, train as long as it take, to complete 100 consecutive push-ups.\n\n16/09/2022 - 15 push-ups\n\n23/09/2022 - 20 push-ups","lastmodified":"2022-10-11T21:42:28.178954372Z","tags":null},"/Personal-development/Sport/Workouts":{"title":"Workouts","content":"\n\n##### Arms\n| Name | Repetitions  | Series  |\n|-|-|-|\n|biceps curl|12|3|\n|military press|12|3|\n|triceps extension|12|3|\n|arms fly|12|3|\n|front raise|12|3|\n|alternative biceps curl|12|3|\n|kickbacks|12|3|\n\n---\n##### Abs\n(30s/10s each to 10min):\n\n- leg raises\n- plank\n- mountain climbers\n- russian twist\n- bicycle crunches\n- flutter kicks\n- reverse crunches\n- hollow body \n- v-ups (???)","lastmodified":"2022-10-11T21:42:28.178954372Z","tags":null},"/Productivity/Concepts":{"title":"Concepts","content":"\nWhat are the **[[Productivity/Concepts]]** for me? \n\nMaybe we'll start by asking what I was looking for in my life?\n\n// freedom\n// knowledge\n// a lot of options\n// answer to everything\n// bind it to subconscious\n// a lot of knowledge :D\n// handle contradictions\n// do not think 0/1\n// think! don't be carried by emotions","lastmodified":"2022-10-11T21:42:28.178954372Z","tags":null},"/Productivity/Definitive-goals":{"title":"Definitive goals","content":"\u003e [!Hint] Your achievement can be no greater than your plans are sound\n\u003e\n\u003e That may seem to be an axiomatic statement, but it is true ~ *[[Knowledge/Books/Think and grow rich]]*\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-11T21:42:28.178954372Z","tags":null},"/Productivity/Discipline":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-11T21:42:28.178954372Z","tags":null},"/Productivity/Game":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-10-11T21:42:28.178954372Z","tags":null},"/Productivity/Motivation":{"title":"Motivation","content":"\n\u003e [!Hint] Don't wait for motivation\n\u003e\n\u003e Motivation doesn't lead to action.
